* Student ID: 918345420
* GitHub Name: AbbasMahdavi021
* Project: Assignment 2 â€“ Structure in Memory and Buffering
*
* File: Mahdavi_Abbas_HW2_main.c
*
* Description: 
This assignment is to write a C program that 
fills the personalInfo object, from the data we give it such
as student ID, as well as data from the command line 
arguments, such as first and last name. Then it passes some 
values to the object fields and buffering data into block. 
Receiving strings and writing them character by character 
until it hits null. We ensured there was no data leaks. 
The purpose of this assignment is to give experience using 
structures, pointers, character strings, enumerated types, 
bitmap fields, and dealing with buffering.
